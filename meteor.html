        <h1>What is Meteor?</h1>
        <img src="images/meteor/Meteor-JS.jpg" alt="meteor" class="rounded float-right" height="250px" width="320px">
        <p>MeteorJS is a do-it-all framework for making JavaScript applications. If you enjoy making websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then you can use those skills to make apps for your PC or phone.</p>
        <p>Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript development framework, a collection of libraries (like tracker & Blaze for front end experience), and packages from the node.js & general JavaScript, all bound together in a tidy way to make web development easier. NodeJS is the platform you need for Meteor Development. It uses the same API and can be used for web and mobile apps development.</p>
        <p>The web framework was introduced and developed by The Meteor Development Group in 2011, securing more than $30 million in Series B funding thanks to its highly-efficient enterprise-grade hosting environment called Galaxy for its range of open-source applications.</p>

        <h1>How Meteor Works?</h1>
        <p>The key innovation of meteor is that all other apps live on the server or client. But meteor includes both client and server. It is a book manager whch not only finds the right book but also follows to home to read that for you.</p>
        <p>Meteor does many cool kinds of stuff, chief among them is database everywhere. The meteor will take a subset of your database and replicate it to the client-side.</p>
        <h3>It consists of two big implications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meteor app sends actual raw data instead of HTML code and it let the client deal with it.</li>
            <li>Access data instantaneously without waiting for a round- trip to the server</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h1>Features of Meteor</h1>
        <img src="images/meteor/met.png" alt="meteor" class="rounded float-right" height="200px" width="320px">

        <ul>
            <li><b>Meteor Integrations</b></li>
                <p>Meteor integrates with all of the popular front-end frameworks out-of-the-box including Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blaze.</p>
                <p>As for databases, Meteor supports any database with a Node.js driver. However, MongoDB is definitely the most popular choice among Meteor developers.</p>
                <p>Are you a mobile developer? Meteor can be used to seamlessly create both iOS and Android apps since Apache Cordova is used to compile the code. Due to its increasing popularity, developers added React Native integration to Meteor.</p>
            <li><b>Server/Backend-How server interact in Meteor Js</b></li>
                <p>Ejson (extension to JSON) is used for serializing & deserialize data moving across the wire via DPP (Distributed data Protocol). If (Meteor.isServer) {} for reflecting changes on server only.</p>
            <li><b>Browser/Frontend What features front end users to interact in Meteor Js</b></li>
                <p>We use if (Meteor.isClient) {} for reflecting changes on frontend/browser.</p>
            <li><b>Browser/Frontend-What features front end users to interact in Meteor Js</b></li>
                <p>The method is an API endpoint for our server. You can define a Method on the server & its counterpart on the client, then call it with some data, write to the database and get the return value in a call-back.</p>
                <p>In the basic app, the meteor.js method is as simple as defining a function. In a complex app, few extra features make it powerful & easily testable. The method should always be defined in common code on the client & server to enable optimistic UI.</p>
            <li><b>Publish-Fetching data from the server</b></li>
                <p>We have a lot of data which we can’t be available to users so for that we tell meteor that publish unflagged posts only and there is no way that client can see flagged posts. This makes the meteor app more secure.</p>
            <li><b>Subscribe-Using data on client-side</b></li>
                <p>Even though we don’t’ want a client to see flagged posts but we cannot send them all data. He should have access to particular data that he has subscribed for.</p>
                <p>Any data we subscribed will be mirrored on the client, thanks to Minimongo. For example, we’re browsing John Nolan’s profile we want his posts only then we subscribe.</p>
            <li><b>Helpers-Interaction with the UI</b></li>
                <p>After publishing and subscribing method now we have to deploy it on UI. So for interaction with UI, the helpers method is used which provides a display. It’s a part of ReactiveContext and will available on each $scope & context and it will stop automatically when $scope is destroyed</p>
            <li><b>Autorun-Checks data modification</b></li>
                <p>Autorun establishes a reactive context and whenever any reactive data it depends on modify then it is re-executed. It always runs at the time of first execution. So each autorun should limit to a particular task.

                    For example, you have an autorun that transforms data when a home button is clicked, and another that retrieves a new page data when URL parameters are updated. So, these tasks are not related to each other so both should have separate autoruns assigned to them, otherwise both will run every time either scenario is triggered</p>
        </ul>

        <h1>Advantages of Meteor</h1>
        <br>
        <h6>JAVASCRIPT ONLY</h6>
            <p>Meteor allows you to develop full-stack applications in one programming language: JavaScript. This means that you will be using the same language both in the client and server, which isn’t necessarily the norm.</p>
        <h6>COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h6>
            <p>Meteor is backed by the community. It was developed as an open-source project and even though they’ve gone commercial with Meteor Cloud, Meteor still boasts a supportive open-source community.</p>
        <h6>CROSS-PLATFORM CODE</h6>
            <p>Meteor allows you to write cross-platform code. Meteor can generate mobile apps from the source code of your web application. You can also work from a single codebase with full Android, iOS and web support. </p>
        <h6>BUILD REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS</h6>
            <p>With Meteor, you can build real-time applications by default. Meteor offers a publication and subscription API which allows developers to publish data from the server’s database, and subscribe to it within the client so changes to the data are reflected in the client in real time.</p>
        <h6>SECURITY</h6>
            <p>Meteor has several built-in security measures including encryption, HTML escaping, secure browser storage and more.</p>

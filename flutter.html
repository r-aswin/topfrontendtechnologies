    <h1>What is flutter?</h1>
    <p>Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).</p>
    <p>To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.

        Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.
        
        If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.</p>

    <h1>How does Flutter work?</h1>
    <p>Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to create high-quality native apps on iOS and Android. It is also the primary way to develop cross-platform apps with Google's new Fuchsia operating system.</p>
    <p>The Flutter framework makes it easy for you to build user interfaces that are beautiful, fast, and responsive. The framework is also extensible, so you can easily add new features and functionality.</p>
    <p>When creating a Flutter app, you'll be working with what's called a "widget." Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app, and they're used to create both the visual components of an app (like buttons and text) and the functional elements (like Stateless Widgets).</p>
    <p>There are two types of widgets: Stateless Widgets and Stateful Widgets. As the name suggests, Stateless Widgets are those with no internal state (or "state," for short). These are the most straightforward widgets and are often used for buttons or text.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Stateful Widgets have an internal state, and this state can be changed over time, and it will be reflected in how the widget looks and behaves. Stateful Widgets are often used for user input fields or animation controllers.</p>
    <p>You can easily create both Stateless and Stateful Widgets using the Dart programming language. You can also use various other development tools to help with the development process, including the Dart Analyzer and the Flutter Inspector.</p>

    <h1>Key features</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Dart programming language:</b> Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is easy to learn and allows you to develop high-quality apps.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Hot reload:</b> Flutter's "hot reload" feature lets you quickly and easily make changes to your app without restarting it.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Expressive and flexible UI:</b> Flutter's UI elements are built using the same principles as Google's Material Design guidelines, giving you an expressive and flexible way to create beautiful apps.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Native performance:</b> Flutter apps are compiled to native code, giving you the best possible performance on both iOS and Android.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Open source:</b> Flutter is an open-source project, which means you can use it for free and contribute to the platform's development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Advantages of Flutter</h1>
    <img src="images/flutter/flutter_ad.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="frrt" height="475" width="425px">

    <ul>
      <li><b>Flutter is fast:</b> It uses a Dart programming language compiled into native code, meaning there is no need for a JavaScript bridge. This results in apps that are fast and responsive.</li>
      <li><b>Flutter creates cross-platform applications:</b> The same code can be used to build apps for both iOS and Android devices from a single codebase rather than switching between different platforms. This can save a lot of time and effort when developing mobile apps. In addition, Flutter can be used for web development to create web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Flutter has a rich set of widgets:</b> Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter apps, and a wide variety of them are available. This makes it easy to create beautiful and custom user interfaces.</li>
      <li><b>Flutter is open source:</b> Anyone can contribute to the development of Flutter, and a growing community of developers is using it. In addition, many helpful docs/tutorials are available online, created by the Flutter community on sites like Github.</li>
      <li><b>Flutter is free:</b> There are no licensing fees or charges for Flutter app development. This makes it an attractive option for startups and developers who want to create high-quality apps without spending much money.</li>
      <li><b>Google backs Flutter:</b> As a Google product, it receives significant support from the tech giant, which constantly works to improve it. This means developers can be confident that Flutter will continue developing and supporting it.</li>
      <li><b>Getting inspired by big successful apps built with Flutter:</b> Some well-known examples include Google Ads, Reflectly, Xianyu by Alibaba, and Postmuse. This is handy for developers who want to see what is possible with Flutter before committing to using it for their projects.</li>
      <li><b>Easy debugging:</b> The Dart programming language has excellent tools for debugging, like the Dart Analyzer and the DevTools suite. This makes it easy to find and fix bugs in Flutter apps.</li>
      <li><b>Automated testing:</b> The Dart programming language has good support for automated testing, and the Flutter framework also has its own set of tools for testing. This makes it easy to create a unit, widget, and integration tests for Flutter apps so developers can constantly optimize and improve the quality of their apps.</li>
      <li><b>Hardware and software utilization:</b> Flutter apps can access the full range of hardware and software capabilities. This means they can take advantage of features such as the camera, GPS, and fingerprint scanner. They can also use platform-specific features, such as push notifications on Android apps or Face ID on Apple iOS.</li>
      <li><b>Different screen adaptability:</b> Flutter applications can be designed to work on various screen sizes and aspect ratios. This makes it easy to create apps that look great on both phones and tablets.</li>

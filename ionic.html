            <h1>What is Ionic Framework?</h1>
            <img src="images/ionic/ionic2_edited.jpg" alt="meteor" class="rounded float-right" height="300px" width="425px">
            <p>Ionic framework is an open-source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile apps, desktop apps, and progressive web apps using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows developers to build once and run everywhere. It was created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013. The first beta version of the Ionic framework was released in March 2014.</p>
            <p>The Ionic framework mainly focuses on front-end user experience or UI interaction, which handles all the look and feel of your app. It is easy to learn and can integrate with other libraries or framework such as Angular, Cordova, etc. It can also be used as a standalone without a front-end framework using a simple script include.</p>
            <p>Officially, the Ionic framework has integration with Angular, but it also provides support for Vue.js and React.js, which are in development.</p>
            <p>Ionic is a great choice for creating basic native functionalities within an application which can run on multiple devices and operating system. The main advantage of the Ionic framework is that we can build the app once, rather than multiple times for separate devices and can deploy everywhere. It makes the app development fast and cost-efficient. It also reduces the need for maintenance.</p>

            <h1>How Does Ionic Framework  Work?</h1>
            <img src="images/ionic/ionicFrom-Scratch_edited.jpg" alt="meteor" class="rounded float-right" height="350px" width="425px">
            <p>Ionic is a framework based on Apache Cordova and Angular. It enables us to build fully functional and advanced mobile apps using web technologies. To create an app with Ionic Framework, you only need to know web technologies like Angular, HTML, and CSS. Ionic transforms a single code written in Angular, HTML, and Saas into a mobile app. Cordova is responsible for implementing a native part of an application.</p>
            <p>An application created using Ionic Framework is a cross-platform app. It is built like a simple web app, but allows us to generate a native app. It has access to all functionalities specific to the phone. As a result, cross-platform apps are not purely native and not entirely web-based. The layout is done via web views, but the app has access to native device’s APIs.</p>
            <p>Combining the native part with a web part gives us a universally applicable solution. An app can be displayed natively and in the browser. Writing once, we can run an app on iOS, Android, Windows, and as a web app. It’s convenient for both business owners and developers.</p>

        <h1>Advantages of Ionic Framework</h1>
        <p>As we said, Ionic Framework is based on well-known technologies. That’s why many developers immediately know how to develop with it. Ionic team doesn’t have to know all of the subtleties connected to each mobile platform. With Ionic, they use popular tools and programming languages.</p>
        <h4>Ionic components and plugins</h4>
        <p>Ionic provides a wide range of components and plugins. A library offers components which act and look like native ones of all of the supported platforms. With Ionic, we are available to use a complete app development kit. We have a rich library of front-end building blocks and UI components. As well as hundreds of most common app icons. Also, plugins provide us with access to phone features, such as Bluetooth, GPS or photo camera.</p>
        <h4>Well written documentation</h4>
        <p>What is more, Ionic provides developers with fully equipped documentation. Most of the things are gathered on the official site. Documentation is accessible and very detailed. Ionic Framework is open source. All the programmers can join the Ionic developers’ community, a forum which is excellent for sharing and getting help. In case of any problems we can also count on special assistance for enterprises. If something won’t work, we may call for support.</p>
        <p>Using Ionic will help you cut the costs. You won’t have to hire a specialist for every platform or train your employees on new technologies. Ionic uses well-known solutions.
            Ionic will help you save some time. Creating an app for every platform would be time-consuming. Thanks to Ionic, you need to develop only one app based on simple web technologies.</p>
        <p>Ionic Framework offers you a wide range of plugins and UI components to make your app look professional.
            Ionic provides you with full, detailed documentation and support.
            You don’t need to know every programming language for mobile app development to create a native app with Ionic.
            If something doesn’t work, you may ask for backup for an enterprise or ask Ionic developers community for help.</p>

        <h1>What is bootstrap?</h1>
        <p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website. A website is called responsive website which can automatically adjust itself to look good on all devices, from smart phones to desktops etc. It is absolutely free to download and use. It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many others.It can also use JavaScript plug-ins.It facilitates you to create responsive designs.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter.It was released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub. In June 2014 Bootstrap was the No.1 project on GitHub.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

            As of July 2022, Bootstrap is the eighth most starred project on GitHub, with over 158,000 stars</p>

            <li><b>JavaScript Plugins:</b>  Bootstrap also contains a lot of custom jQuery plugins. You can easily include them all, or one by one.</li>
            <li><b>Customize:</b> Bootstrap components are customizable and you can customize Bootstrap's components, LESS variables, and jQuery plugins to get your own style.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div  class="container">
        <h1 id="advback">Advantages</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Its responsive grid</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/bootstrapgrid.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>No more spending hours coding your own grid—Bootstrap comes with its own grid system predefined.  Now, you can get straight to filling your containers with content. Defining custom breakpoints for each column is a snap using their extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large breaks. You can also simply stick to the default as it might already meet the needs of your site.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Its responsive images</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/Bootstrap-Responsiveimges.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>Bootstrap comes with its own code for automatically resizing images based on the current screen size. Just add the .img-responsive class to your images, and the predefined CSS rules take care of the rest. Let Bootstrap resize your images for you! It can even change the shape of your images with the addition of classes like img-circle and img-rounded, and that’s without going back and forth between the code and your design software</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Its components</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/components.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>Bootstrap comes with a whole barrelful of components you can easily tack onto your web page, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigation bars</li>
            <li>Dropdowns</li>
            <li>Progress bars</li>
            <li>Thumbnails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not only is it a breeze to add eye-catching design elements to your webpage, you’ll also be able to rest assured knowing that every one of them will look great no matter the screen size or device used to view them. That’s a lot of ready-made functionality right at your fingertips.</p>
        <p>For a more complete list of addable features, check out the component documentation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Its JavaScript</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/bootstrapwithjvascript.jpeg" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>Bootstrap also allows developers to take advantage of over a dozen custom JQuery plugins. This library gives you even more room to play with interactivity, offering up easy solutions for modal popups, transitions, image carousels, and—one of my personal favorites—a plugin called scrollspy, which automatically updates your navigation bar as you scroll through a page.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Its documentation</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/documentation.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>Simply put, Bootstrap’s documentation is some of the best we’ve ever seen. Every piece of code is described and explained in explicit detail on their website.</p>
        <p>Explanations also include code samples for basic implementation, simplifying the process for even the most beginner of beginners. All you need to do is choose a component, copy and paste the code into your page, and tweak from there.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Its customizability</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/custom.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>One of the main critiques when it comes to frameworks such as Bootstrap is their size—the weight they throw around can really slow down your application upon first load. The current version of Bootstrap’s CSS file, for example, is a whopping 119 KB. While this may not seem especially large compared to image and video files, for a CSS file, that’s enormous!</p>
        <p>What it allows you to do to combat this, however, is customize which functionality you want to include in your download. By simply going to their Customize and Download page, you can check off the features you won’t need for your application, trimming the weight off your file and saving your users the additional load time. Customization is key!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Its community</h3>
        <img src="images/bootstrap/community.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="grid" height="125px" width="175px" >
        <p>As with so many open-source projects, Bootstrap has a large community of designers and developers behind it. Being hosted on GitHub makes it easy for developers to modify and contribute to Bootstrap’s codebase. It also makes it easy for people to collaborate, lend their advice, and interact with peers and fellow users.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap has an active Twitter page, a Bootstrap blog, and even a dedicated Slack room. And that doesn’t even get into the wealth of developers willing to help with technical problems on Stack Overflow, where all questions can be found under the bootstrap-4 tag.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Its external templates</h3>
        <p>As its popularity grew, people started creating templates based on Bootstrap in order to accelerate the web development process even further. There are many websites out there dedicated to sharing and buying custom templates based on Bootstrap.</p>
        <p>Here are just a few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp">W3Schools Bootstrap templates</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://startbootstrap.com/themes">Start Bootstrap templates</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">Wrap Bootstrap templates</a></li>
